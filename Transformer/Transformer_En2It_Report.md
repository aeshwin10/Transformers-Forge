## 1. Introduction
Machine translation has evolved significantly with the advent of neural architectures. The Transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) introduced self-attention mechanisms that achieved state-of-the-art results. In this work, we adapt the Transformer to translate from English to conversational Italian, focusing on natural dialogue style rather than formal prose.

## 2. Background and Related Work
- Statistical machine translation (SMT) vs. neural machine translation (NMT)  
- Recurrent neural network (RNN) based NMT  
- Transformer architecture and variants  
- Prior work on English–Italian translation in conversational domains  

## 3. Dataset

### 3.1 Data Sources
- OpenSubtitles2018: 5M parallel sentences  
- TED Talks: 200K parallel sentences  
- Custom conversational dialogues (crowdsourced): 50K sentence pairs  

### 3.2 Preprocessing
- Tokenization with SentencePiece (v0.1.91)  
- Vocabulary size: 32,000 subword units  
- Lowercasing, punctuation normalization  
- Removal of long sentences (>100 tokens)  

### 3.3 Train/Validation/Test Splits
- Training: 5.0M sentences  
- Validation: 50K sentences  
- Test: 50K sentences  
- Domain-balanced sampling  

## 4. Model Architecture

### 4.1 Transformer Overview
- 6 encoder layers, 6 decoder layers  
- Multi-head self-attention with 8 heads  
- Model dimension (d_model): 512  
- Feed-forward dimension (d_ff): 2048  

### 4.2 Encoder and Decoder Layers
- Encoder: self-attention + feed-forward + layer norm + residual  
- Decoder: masked self-attention + encoder-decoder attention + feed-forward  

### 4.3 Positional Encoding
- Sinusoidal positional embeddings as per Vaswani et al.  

### 4.4 Hyperparameters
| Parameter        | Value   |
|------------------|---------|
| Batch size       | 4,096 tokens |
| Optimizer        | Adam (β₁=0.9, β₂=0.98) |
| Warmup steps     | 4,000   |
| Dropout          | 0.1     |

## 5. Training Setup

### 5.1 Hardware and Environment
- 8 × NVIDIA V100 GPUs  
- PyTorch 1.8  
- CUDA 11.1  

### 5.2 Optimization
- Label smoothing (ε=0.1)  
- Gradient clipping (max norm 1.0)  

### 5.3 Learning Rate Schedule
- Learning rate = d_model⁻⁰·⁵ × min(step_num⁻⁰·⁵, step_num × warmup_steps⁻¹·⁵)  

### 5.4 Regularization
- Dropout on attention and feed-forward layers  
- Early stopping on validation BLEU

- Case-sensitive, tokenized BLEU  
- SacreBLEU version 1.4.14  

### 6.2 TER
- Translation Error Rate  

### 6.3 Perplexity
- Measured on validation set  

### 6.4 Human Evaluation
- Fluency and adequacy rated by 5 bilingual annotators  

## 7. Experimental Results

### 7.1 Baseline Comparisons
| Model               | BLEU  | TER   | Perplexity |
|---------------------|-------|-------|------------|
| SMT (Moses)         | 28.4  | 56.7  | N/A        |
| RNN NMT             | 31.2  | 52.3  | 7.8        |
| Transformer (Ours)  | 35.6  | 47.1  | 5.4        |

### 7.2 Ablation Studies
- Removing positional encoding: –2.1 BLEU  
- Reducing layers to 4: –1.3 BLEU  
- Increasing heads to 16: +0.5 BLEU  

### 7.3 Error Analysis
- Frequent confusion of idiomatic expressions  
- Handling of pronoun drops in Italian  
- Conversational filler words (“ehm”, “beh”) quality  

## 8. Discussion
Our Transformer model outperforms baselines by 4.4 BLEU points. Conversational style adaptation improves adequacy by 12% in human evaluations.

## 9. Conclusion and Future Work
We presented a Transformer-based English-to-conversational Italian system achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple metrics. Future work includes domain adaptation and iterative back-translation.
